CSS App Mask
============

### Turn any image into app icon

Its as simple as that, bare in mind that in order to see it in its full potential you'll need a browser that supports webkit (specifically the new filter options).

[Demo page](http://daviddarnes.github.io/css-app-mask/).

### Usage

Just [download the repo](https://github.com/daviddarnes/css-app-mask/archive/master.zip), inport the css file into your project and wrap the png, or svg, with an element called ```.app```. Job done.

If you want to change the colour you can either spend forever changing it throughout the css, or you can use the less file and change it in one place! Preprocessors are awesome.
