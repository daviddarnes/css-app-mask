CSS App Mask
============

A mask to turn any transparent png into app icon, using CSS
--------------------

Its as simple as that, bare in mind that in order to see it in its full potential you'll need a browser that supports webkit (specifically the new filter options).

Usage
--------------------
Just include the CSS file and wrap the png with any element with a class of 'app'. Job done.

If you want to change the colour you can either spend forever changing it throughout the CSS, or you can use the LESS file and change it in one place! Preprocessors are awesome.
